### Lessons learned:

Nov 10
Building my database has proven to be difficult with SQL workbench. I had multiple small issues that would not allow me to forward engineer after creating a second table. The main issue was with the foreign key, but my skills with SQL workbench have improved! Building out the JPA of my job tracker was fairly straight forward and without complications. Moving into my Spring boot/rest it began to get more complicated but taking my time and assuring my persistence was correct before starting to build the repositories. I Felt very comfortable building out the basic services, Impls and controllers. The main issue i am running into now is persisting a new job with a new company through the URL. in the last project i was able to do that with a cascade through the JSP. will continue to work on that this week while stating to build out the front end.
